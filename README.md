the topic and breaks the language barrier

## Methodology:

Step 1: Convert meeting to a textual format, using Speech Recognition

Step 2: The entire text will be summarized based on the ML model, NLTK library, and NLP to give us well-
documented MOM

Step 3: Our app will allow converting the summarized text to multilingual languages, to remove the barrier of
English.

Step 4: Moving a step ahead we will convert the summarized text to audio form thus providing help to visually
impaired people.

Step 5: So our app will have 4 layeringâ€™s and will solve all the suggestions provided.

## Technology:

â€¢ Frontend: React JS, Material UI, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

â€¢ Backend: Django ( Python Framework)

â€¢ Database: SQLite

â€¢ Other Technologies: Machine Learning, NLTK Library

## Functional Specifications:

â€¢ Transcription of Meeting: Convert meeting into textual format

â€¢ Summarization of Text: The entire meeting transcript is summarized to give well-documented MOM

â€¢ Translation into multiple regional languages: Summarized text will be available in regional languages.

â€¢ Text to Speech Conversion: Summarized text can be converted to audio, which will be helpful for
visually challenged people.

â€¢ Email Notifications: Send mail to the user with his/her MOM
